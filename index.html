          I like problem solving and building software which users find
          intuitive and responsive. I have an interest in both front end and
          back end development. Graduated from the University of Maryland,
          College Park with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. Fluent in
          both English and Spanish.

        to face.

        <p>Creator & Developer</p>

          Created a website based off of
          <a target="_blank" href="https://travle.earth/?travle-lang=en"
            >travle </a
          >which involves finding the shortest possible path to connect two US
          states. Users are subsequently given feedback on how optimal their
          choice was in connecting the two states using the shortest path. This
          required the knowledge of languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The
          websites dynamic behavior is done through React hooks. The map
          projection was done through the d3.js library. The shortest path and
          feedback on each choice required the knowledge of data structures and
          algorithms. Specifically queues and the graph algorithm Breadth-first
          search(BFS) which I used on the starting state to figure out the
          distance between it and the destination state. During BFS I would keep
          track of each first-time visited states and store information on how
          far away it was from the starting state. This allowed me to work
          backwords starting at the destination state and using a modified BFS
          to reach the starting state. The modification involved limiting the
          states added to the queue by requiring the state to have a distance
          exactly one less than the current state. This would in turn give the
          shortest path(s). A guess was said to be close if its distance was off
          by one to a optimal state. This was found without requiring another
          BFS, by storing the optimal states they could be itterated over and
          its neighbors (excluding those in the optimal set) would be the close
          states.

          Created a blogging website where users can create an account and post
          and view blogs. This involved connecting front end and back end. The
          front end was programmed in TypeScript using the React library. In
          order to route to other pages this required React Router which also
          helped in creating secure routes for pages requiring an account. The
          back end was done using JavaScript using Node.js. Through express
          framework I was able to create an API which deals with calls from the
          front end to handle tasks like viewing, adding and editing data. This
          data is stored using PostgreSQL through a Docker container. Sessions
          is handled through Redis which checks each request's cookie to see if
          the user is logged in. The blog themselves are written using Markdown
          and then when viewed the text is parsed into HTML elements for a
          better viewing experience.
